# Reputable: Pricing & Positioning Research

## Executive Summary

Reputable occupies a unique position at the intersection of three markets: **customer review platforms**, **product sampling/UGC generation**, and **clinical research**. This creates both opportunity and complexity in pricing. The product delivers significantly more value than traditional review tools (verified studies, wearable data, clinical-style claims) while being far more accessible than traditional clinical trials.

**Recommended positioning:** "Verified Product Studies" — positioned between review platforms and clinical research, enabling brands to make credible, data-backed claims that go beyond star ratings.

**Recommended pricing:** $1,500-3,000/study (entry) to $5,000-15,000/study (premium), with participant rebates passed through as a separate line item.

## 2. Pricing Model Analysis

### 2.1 Common B2B SaaS Pricing Models

| Model | Pros | Cons | Best For |
|-------|------|------|----------|
| **Per study** | Simple, predictable ROI | Revenue lumpy | High-value deliverables |
| **Per participant** | Scales with usage | Unpredictable costs for buyer | Research platforms |
| **Subscription + usage** | Predictable base + growth | Complex pricing | High-volume users |
| **Tiered subscription** | Clear upgrade path | May leave money on table | Standardized products |
| **Value-based (% of outcomes)** | Aligned incentives | Hard to measure | Performance marketing |

### 2.2 Recommended Model for Reputable

**Primary: Per-Study Pricing with Participant Pass-through**

Structure:
```
Total Cost = Platform Fee + (Participants × Rebate Amount)
```

Example:
- Platform fee: $2,500
- 50 participants × $40 rebate = $2,000
- **Total: $4,500**

**Why this works:**
1. **Clear value delivery** - Brand pays for a study, gets defined deliverables
2. **Transparent participant costs** - Rebates shown separately, builds trust
3. **Scalable** - Larger studies generate more revenue naturally
4. **Predictable for brands** - Can budget per SKU/product launch

### 2.3 Suggested Tier Structure

| Tier | Platform Fee | Included Participants | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------------------|----------|
| **Starter** | $1,500 | Up to 30 | Product validation, small brands |
| **Growth** | $3,000 | Up to 75 | Launch campaigns, mid-market |
| **Pro** | $5,000 | Up to 150 | Flagship products, funded brands |
| **Enterprise** | $8,000-15,000 | Custom (200+) | Portfolio brands, clinical claims |

Additional pricing considerations:
- Wearable integration add-on: +$500-1,000 per study
- Extended study duration (>28 days): +25%
- White-label reports: +$500
- Priority onboarding: +$500

## 3. Value Proposition Messaging

### 3.1 Core Value Proposition

**For DTC Wellness Brands:**

> "Turn your customers into clinical proof. Run verified 28-day studies that generate testimonials with data — not just star ratings."

**Key differentiators to emphasize:**
1. **Verified purchase + verified results** — participants bought the product AND completed the study
2. **Wearable data integration** — Oura, Whoop data adds objectivity
3. **Before/after structure** — clinical methodology without clinical costs
4. **Ready-to-use claims** — "87% of participants reported improved sleep after 28 days"

### 3.2 Messaging by Audience Segment

**Emerging DTC Brands ($1M-10M revenue):**
> "Make claims your competitors can't. Verified studies starting at $1,500."
- Emphasize: affordable entry point, competitive advantage, social proof upgrade
- Pain point: standing out in crowded market, building credibility

**Established Wellness Brands ($10M-50M revenue):**
> "The evidence your retail buyers are asking for. Clinical-style results without the clinical timeline or budget."
- Emphasize: retail readiness, credible claims for buyer meetings
- Pain point: retailers demanding substantiation, Amazon requiring documentation

**VC-Backed Brands:**
> "Investor-grade product validation. Show your next round data that proves product-market fit beyond NPS."
- Emphasize: data storytelling, objective proof of efficacy
- Pain point: proving product actually works vs. good marketing

### 3.3 Competitive Messaging Angles

**vs. Review Platforms (Yotpo, Stamped, etc.):**
> "Reviews show opinion. Studies show results."
- Star ratings are subjective and easily manipulated
- Reputable provides structured methodology and objective data points
- Wearable integration adds measurable outcomes

**vs. Clinical Research (Citruslabs, CROs):**
> "Clinical credibility at startup speed."
- 10x faster than traditional studies (28 days vs. 6-12 months)
- 5-10x more affordable ($1,500-5,000 vs. $25,000-100,000)
- Uses your actual customers, not recruited strangers
- Perfect for iteration and ongoing validation

**vs. Sampling Programs (Bazaarvoice, Influenster):**
> "From seeding to studying."
- Sampling generates volume; studies generate credibility
- Same participant incentive model, but with methodology
- Data you can actually use in marketing claims

                          |
                   Clinical Trials
                    (Citruslabs)
                          |
              +-----------+-----------+
              |                       |
    LOW COST --+-- REPUTABLE --+-- HIGH COST
              |     (sweet spot)      |
              +-----------+-----------+
                          |
                   Review Platforms

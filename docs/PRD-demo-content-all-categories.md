# PRD: Demo Content for All Wellness Categories

**Goal:** Enable Kyle (Head of Sales) to run compelling "30 participants (full demo)" demonstrations for ANY wellness category, not just Sleep.

**Why Now:** Sleep demos are excellent. But when a gut health brand, weight loss supplement, or anxiety product company wants a demo, we fall back to generic content that doesn't resonate. Kyle needs every category to feel as authentic and impressive as Sleep.

## Problem Statement

### Current State

| Category | Archetype Quotes | Journey Quotes | Wearables | Demo Quality |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|-----------|--------------|
| Sleep | 78 | 100+ | 6 metrics | Excellent |
| Stress | 70+ | 15+ | 2 metrics | Good |
| Recovery | 40+ | 12+ | 3 metrics | Good |
| Energy | 60+ | 15+ | None | Okay |
| Focus | 50+ | 15+ | None | Okay |
| Mood | None | 12+ | None | Poor |
| Anxiety | None | 12+ | None | Poor |
| Pain | None | 12+ | None | Poor |
| Gut | None | 12+ | None | Poor |
| Weight | None | 12+ | None | Poor |
| Skin | None | 12+ | None | Poor |
| Fitness | None | None | Partial | Bad |
| Hair | None | 12+ | None | Poor |
| Immunity | None | None | None | Bad |
| Libido | None | None | None | Bad |
| Satiety | None | None | None | Bad |
| Resilience | None | None | None | Bad |

**The problem:** When Kyle demos a Weight category study, all 8 completed participants have the same generic baseline motivation: *"I've tried everything and nothing has worked."* This doesn't resonate with a weight loss brand founder who expects to see realistic customer pain stories.

### Desired State

Every category should have:
1. **Distinct participant personalities** - 5 archetypes with category-specific quotes
2. **Authentic pain stories** - Baseline motivations that match real customer struggles
3. **Compelling journeys** - Day 14 and Day 28 quotes showing transformation
4. **Tier-appropriate metrics** - Wearables for Tier 1-2, assessments for Tier 3-4
5. **Kyle-worthy polish** - No "ignore this part" moments in any demo

---

## Tier System Context

Understanding tiers is critical for building appropriate demo content:

### Tier 1: Wearables Primary
**Categories:** Sleep, Recovery, Fitness

These demos MUST show impressive wearable metrics because that's the product's core value proposition.

**Demo expectation:** "Look at Sarah's Oura Ring data - her deep sleep went from 28 to 54 minutes."

**Metrics to show:**
- Sleep: Total sleep, deep sleep, REM, latency, efficiency, HRV
- Recovery: HRV, resting HR, sleep quality
- Fitness: Active minutes, VO2 max proxy, recovery scores

### Tier 2: Wearables Co-Primary
**Categories:** Stress

Wearables validate the subjective improvement. Both matter equally.

**Demo expectation:** "Marcus's HRV improved 47%, and he reports feeling calmer in meetings."

**Metrics to show:**
- Stress: HRV (higher = better), Resting HR (lower = better), stress assessment scores

### Tier 3: Assessment Primary, Wearables Supporting
**Categories:** Energy, Focus, Mood, Anxiety, Pain, Resilience

Assessments are the hero. Wearables (if connected) provide supporting validation.

**Demo expectation:** "Jennifer's anxiety score dropped from 72 to 31. Her sleep also improved according to her Fitbit."

**Metrics to show:**
- Primary: Category assessment composite score (0-100 scale)
- Supporting: HRV or sleep quality if wearable connected (optional)

### Tier 4: Assessment Only
**Categories:** Skin, Gut, Immunity, Hair, Weight, Libido, Satiety

No wearable metrics apply. Assessments and photo documentation are proof.

**Demo expectation:** "David's gut health score improved 62%. Here's his daily symptom log showing bloating decreased."

**Metrics to show:**
- Category assessment composite score
- Specific symptom tracking (bloating frequency, skin clarity rating, etc.)
- Photo documentation for visual categories (skin, hair, weight)

## Acceptance Tests

### AT-1: Gut Health Demo Quality

**Persona:** Kyle (Head of Sales)
- Goal: Demo a gut health supplement study to a probiotic brand founder
- Constraint: Must feel authentic to someone who knows the gut health space
- Context: Live Zoom call, prospect is evaluating whether to run a study

**Starting State:**
- Kyle is viewing a demo Gut Health study in Brand View
- Study has no enrollments yet
- Prospect is waiting to see "what the dashboard would look like with data"

**Journey:**
1. Kyle clicks "30 participants (full demo)" seeder button
2. Kyle navigates to Live Insights tab to show enrollment pain stories
3. Kyle navigates to Results tab to show completed participant journeys
4. Kyle clicks "Create Content" on a participant card
5. Kyle shows the verification page for a participant

**Checkpoints:**
- [ ] Step 2: At least 5 distinct baseline motivations visible (not all the same)
- [ ] Step 2: Pain stories reference gut-specific struggles (bloating, food fear, IBS symptoms)
- [ ] Step 2: At least 3 different archetypes represented (desperate, skeptic, struggler visible)
- [ ] Step 3: Completed participant quotes reference gut-specific improvements
- [ ] Step 3: Assessment scores show meaningful improvement (not just "+10%")
- [ ] Step 4: Generated captions reference gut health language (not generic wellness)
- [ ] Step 5: Verification page shows symptom tracking data (not just assessment scores)

**End State:**
- Demo completed with prospect saying "this is exactly what our customers sound like"
- No moments where Kyle had to say "imagine this says gut health instead"
- Prospect can envision their product's customers in the demo data

**Failure Modes:**
- [ ] All baseline motivations are identical or generic
- [ ] Pain stories mention "sleep" or "stress" instead of gut issues
- [ ] Assessment improvements are implausible (e.g., +200%)
- [ ] Generated captions say "the product" instead of gut health language
- [ ] Kyle has to explain "this is placeholder content"

---

- [ ] Step 3: Realistic improvement ranges (not everyone lost 30 pounds)
- [ ] Step 4: Captions appropriate for weight loss marketing (compliant, not over-promised)
- [ ] Step 5: Assessment data shows multiple dimensions (not just "weight score")

**End State:**
- Prospect sees a credible, evidence-based approach to weight loss claims
- Demo participants feel like real people, not testimonial clichés
- Kyle confidently explains the methodology without hesitation

**Failure Modes:**
- [ ] Generic "I've tried everything" without weight-specific context
- [ ] Shame-based or judgmental language in any quote
- [ ] Unrealistic results (everyone lost significant weight)
- [ ] No mention of non-scale benefits
- [ ] Captions make weight loss claims that feel non-compliant

---

### AT-3: Anxiety Demo Quality

**Persona:** Kyle (Head of Sales)
- Goal: Demo an anxiety/calm supplement study to a mental wellness brand
- Constraint: Mental health is sensitive - must be appropriate and not clinical

**Starting State:**
- Kyle is viewing a demo Anxiety study in Brand View

**Journey:**
1. Kyle seeds demo data
2. Kyle reviews Live Insights participant stories
3. Kyle shows Results transformations

- Prospect sees how to position evidence without overclaiming
- Kyle never has to caveat "this isn't medical advice"

**Failure Modes:**
- [ ] Clinical language (panic attacks, disorder, diagnosis)
- [ ] Quotes suggesting medical treatment needed
- [ ] Wearable metrics shown for anxiety (inappropriate for Tier 3)
- [ ] Captions that could be seen as medical claims

---

### AT-4: Tier Appropriateness Check

**Persona:** Kyle (Head of Sales)
- Goal: Verify that each tier shows appropriate evidence types
- Constraint: Must not show wearable data for categories where it doesn't apply
- Context: Prospect might ask "why no Oura Ring data for gut health?"

**Journey:**
1. Kyle demos a Tier 1 category (Sleep) - seeds and reviews
2. Kyle demos a Tier 3 category (Mood) - seeds and reviews
3. Kyle demos a Tier 4 category (Skin) - seeds and reviews

**Checkpoints:**
- [ ] Tier 1 (Sleep): Wearable metrics prominently displayed with device names
- [ ] Tier 1 (Sleep): 4+ different wearable metrics shown per participant
- [ ] Tier 3 (Mood): Assessment scores shown as primary metric
- [ ] Tier 3 (Mood): No wearable metrics displayed (or clearly labeled as "bonus")
- [ ] Tier 4 (Skin): Assessment scores shown, no wearable section
- [ ] Tier 4 (Skin): Photo documentation mentioned or shown

**End State:**
- Each tier's demo shows the RIGHT type of evidence
- Kyle can explain why gut health doesn't have Oura data
- No confusion about what evidence type applies to each category

**Failure Modes:**
- [ ] Tier 4 category showing wearable metrics
- [ ] Tier 1 category missing wearable data
- [ ] Tier 3 category with wearable data presented as primary

---

### AT-5: Kyle's Pride Test

**Persona:** Kyle (Head of Sales)
- Goal: Would Kyle be PROUD to show this demo, not just willing?
- Constraint: "Good enough" is not good enough
- Context: Kyle is on a call with a brand founder who is skeptical of wellness marketing

**Starting State:**
- Kyle has a prospect who makes [Gut/Weight/Anxiety/Mood/Pain/Skin] products
- The prospect has seen too many fake testimonials and wants real evidence

**Journey:**
1. Kyle opens the appropriate category demo study
2. Kyle seeds 30 participants
3. Kyle walks through Live Insights, Results, Content Generator
4. Kyle shares a verification link

**Checkpoints (The "Hell Yes" Bar):**
- [ ] Kyle would show this demo to his toughest prospect without hesitation
- [ ] Kyle would screen-share this on a recorded call
- [ ] Kyle would send the verification link in a follow-up email
- [ ] Kyle would NOT say "imagine this is for your category" or "ignore this part"
- [ ] Kyle would feel confident if the prospect asked to see another participant
- [ ] Kyle would reference specific participant quotes to illustrate points

**End State:**
- Kyle says "This is going to close deals" not "This is okay"
- Demo feels like a competitive advantage, not a checkbox
- Prospects leave wanting to sign up, not needing to "think about it"

**Failure Modes (Immediate Fail):**
- [ ] Kyle would preface any section with "this is still being worked on"
- [ ] Kyle would avoid scrolling to certain participants
- [ ] Kyle would switch to Sleep demo instead of staying in requested category
- [ ] Kyle would turn off screen share to "fix something"
- [ ] Any participant quote that makes Kyle cringe

## Content Quality Guidelines

### Quote Writing Principles

1. **Specificity over generality**
   - Bad: "I've tried everything and nothing works"
   - Good: "I've tried three different probiotics, an elimination diet, and even got tested for SIBO"

2. **Emotional truth without melodrama**
   - Bad: "My life is ruined by bloating"
   - Good: "I avoid lunch meetings because I know I'll be uncomfortable by 2pm"

3. **Archetype consistency**
   - Desperate: Long-suffering, multiple failed attempts, high stakes
   - Skeptic: Data-driven, prove-it-to-me, references past disappointments
   - Power User: Already tracking, optimization mindset, wants marginal gains
   - Struggler: Relatable everyday person, moderate pain, wants simple solution
   - Optimist: Minor issue, preventive mindset, positive framing

4. **Category authenticity**
   - Use terminology actual customers use
   - Reference real products/approaches they've tried
   - Include category-specific symptoms and goals

5. **Compliance-safe language**
   - Avoid medical claims
   - Use "support" not "treat"
   - Focus on wellness, not diagnosis

### Journey Quote Principles

1. **Day 14 quotes** should show:
   - Early signs of change (or skepticism)
   - "Noticing something" language
   - Cautious optimism or continued doubt

2. **Day 28 quotes** should show:
   - Clear articulation of change
   - Specific examples ("I realized when...")
   - Future-looking statements

3. **Outcome distribution** (maintain across all categories):
   - 60% Improved: Clear positive change
   - 25% Mixed: Some improvement, some unchanged
   - 15% No Change: Honest "didn't work for me"

---

## Success Metrics

1. **Category Coverage:** All 17 categories have 80+ archetype quotes
2. **Demo Quality:** Kyle rates each category demo 8+/10
3. **Sales Effectiveness:** No category requires "imagine this" caveats
4. **Prospect Response:** Demos result in "this is exactly our customers" feedback
5. **Content Authenticity:** Quotes pass the "would a real customer say this" test

---

## Timeline

- **Phase 1 (Gut, Weight, Anxiety, Mood):** 1 sprint
- **Phase 2 (Pain, Skin, Fitness):** 1 sprint
- **Phase 3 (Hair, Immunity, Resilience, Libido, Satiety):** 1 sprint
- **Phase 4 (Polish existing):** 0.5 sprint

**Total:** ~3.5 sprints to have Kyle-ready demos for all categories

---

## Open Questions

1. Should Tier 4 categories show photo upload placeholders in demo mode?
2. Should we create category-specific "sample products" for demos (fake brand names)?
3. Do we need different quote content for B2B vs DTC brand positioning?
4. Should the seeder have category-specific participant counts (e.g., more for Sleep)?

---

## Appendix: Category-Archetype Quote Template

For each category, we need 80 quotes distributed as:

| Archetype | Count | Focus |
|-----------|-------|-------|
| Desperate | 20 | Severe, long-suffering, tried everything |
| Skeptic | 12 | Data-driven, prove it, past disappointments |
| Power User | 16 | Already tracking, optimization, marginal gains |
| Struggler | 24 | Everyday person, moderate pain, wants simple |
| Optimist | 8 | Minor issue, preventive, positive framing |

Each quote should include:
- `motivation`: Why they're trying this product
- `hopedResults`: What they want to achieve
- `triedOther`: What they've tried before (category-specific)
- `villainDuration`: How long they've struggled

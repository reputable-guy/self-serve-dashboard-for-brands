# Regulatory Landscape: Wellness/Supplement Claims in the US

*Research compiled for Reputable - January 2026*

## Executive Summary

Wellness and supplement brands face a complex regulatory landscape when making efficacy claims. Two primary federal agencies govern this space: the **FDA** (labeling) and **FTC** (advertising). This document outlines what brands can legally claim, required disclosures, and recommended language for Reputable's verified product studies.

## 1. What Brands Can Legally Claim

### Claim Hierarchy (Most → Least Restrictive)

| Claim Type | Definition | Requirements | Risk Level |
|------------|-----------|--------------|------------|
| **Drug Claims** | Claims to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent disease | FDA approval required; clinical trials | 🔴 Highest |
| **Health Claims** | Relationship between substance and disease risk reduction | FDA pre-approval or "qualified health claim" with disclaimer | 🟠 High |
| **Structure/Function Claims** | Describes effect on body structure/function | Substantiation required; FDA notification within 30 days; disclaimer required | 🟡 Moderate |
| **Nutrient Content Claims** | Characterizes level of nutrient | Must meet FDA-defined thresholds | 🟢 Lower |

### Key Terminology Analysis

#### ❌ "Clinically Proven"
- **Risk: HIGH**
- Implies scientific certainty and conclusive evidence
- Requires robust clinical evidence with statistical significance
- FTC considers this a strong claim requiring extensive substantiation
- Most wellness studies cannot support this claim

#### ⚠️ "Clinically Tested"
- **Risk: MODERATE**
- Literally true if product was tested in a clinical setting
- BUT: May imply positive results to consumers
- FTC looks at consumer perception, not just literal truth
- Must have actual clinical testing to use

#### ✅ "Clinically Studied"
- **Risk: MODERATE-LOW**
- Similar to "clinically tested"
- Should have actual study data to support

#### ✅ "Verified" / "Customer-Verified"
- **Risk: LOWER** (with proper context)
- Describes methodology rather than outcome
- Should clarify what was verified and how
- Reputable's recommended term: **"Verified Product Study"**

### What Reputable Studies Can Support

Based on 28-day customer studies with daily check-ins and optional wearable data:

**CAN claim:**
- "Verified by [X] customers in a 28-day product study"
- "In a customer study, [X]% reported [specific outcome]"
- "Customer-reported improvements in [metric]"
- Specific quantifiable results from the study

**CANNOT claim (without additional evidence):**
- "Clinically proven to..."
- "Scientifically proven..."
- Disease treatment or prevention
- Guaranteed results

## 2. FTC Guidelines on Testimonials and Endorsements

### Core Requirements (Updated 2023)

The FTC's Endorsement Guides were significantly updated in June 2023. Key requirements:

#### Material Connection Disclosure
Any connection between endorser and brand must be disclosed if it would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement:
- Payment or compensation
- Free products
- Affiliate relationships
- Employment relationships

#### Disclosure Requirements
- **Clear and conspicuous** - difficult to miss, easily understandable
- **Same format as claim** - if video, disclose in video (not just description)
- **Unavoidable** - hyperlink disclosures are generally insufficient
- **Every post** - must disclose in each endorsement, not just initially

#### Testimonial Substantiation
- Testimonials cannot claim more than advertiser could claim directly
- If testimonial describes atypical results, ad must clearly disclose typical results
- "Results not typical" alone is INSUFFICIENT - must show what IS typical

### For Reputable Studies Specifically

**Required disclosures when using study results:**
1. Study methodology (sample size, duration, conditions)
2. Whether participants received product free
3. What typical results were vs. exceptional results
4. Any limitations of the study

**Example compliant language:**
> "In a 28-day verified product study with [X] customers, participants reported an average [Y]% improvement in [metric]. Individual results may vary. Study participants received the product at no cost."

---

## 3. FDA Structure/Function Claims vs. Drug Claims

### Structure/Function Claims (Permitted for Supplements)

**Definition:** Claims that describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function of the body.

**Requirements:**
1. Must have substantiation that claim is truthful and not misleading
2. Must notify FDA within 30 days of first marketing
3. **Must include disclaimer:**
   > "This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."

**Examples of PERMITTED structure/function claims:**
- "Supports healthy immune function"
- "Maintains joint health"
- "Promotes digestive wellness"
- "Helps maintain healthy sleep patterns"

### Drug Claims (NOT Permitted Without FDA Approval)

**Definition:** Claims that product can diagnose, treat, cure, mitigate, or prevent disease.

**Examples of PROHIBITED drug claims:**
- "Reduces risk of heart disease"
- "Treats arthritis"
- "Cures insomnia"
- "Prevents colds"

### The Gray Area: Implied Claims

The FTC and FDA look at the **net impression** of all marketing elements:

**Elements that can imply drug claims:**
- Product name (e.g., "ArthriCure" implies arthritis cure)
- Images (e.g., before/after showing disease symptoms)
- Context (e.g., references to symptoms, diseases)
- Endorsements mentioning conditions

**FTC Example from guidance:**
> "An ad for an herbal supplement claims the product boosts the immune system to help maintain a healthy nose and throat during the winter season. The ad features the product name 'Cold Away' and includes images of people sneezing and coughing... Even without the product name and images, the reference to nose and throat health during the winter season likely conveys a cold prevention claim."

## 4. Required Disclaimers

### Mandatory FDA Disclaimer for Structure/Function Claims

**Exact text required (cannot be modified):**

Singular:
> "This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."

Plural:
> "These statements have not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."

**Placement requirements:**
- Immediately adjacent to claim, OR
- On same panel/page in a box linked by symbol (e.g., asterisk)

**Format requirements:**
- Boldface type
- Minimum 1/16 inch height

### Recommended Additional Disclaimers for Reputable Studies

1. **Study limitations:**
   > "Results based on a [X]-day customer study with [N] participants. Individual results may vary."

2. **Testimonial disclosure:**
   > "Participants received product at no cost in exchange for their honest feedback."

3. **Typical results:**
   > "Average reported improvement was [X]%. Results ranged from [Y] to [Z]."

4. **Not medical advice:**
   > "These results are not intended as medical advice. Consult your healthcare provider before starting any supplement regimen."

# UX Review: Kyle's Perspective (Head of Sales)

**Reviewer:** Kyle, Head of Sales at Reputable Health  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Focus:** Demo-ability, clarity, and "wow" factor for wellness brand founders

---

## Executive Summary

Overall, this dashboard is **demo-ready** and would genuinely impress brand founders. The information architecture is solid, the visual design is premium, and there are several "wow" moments (Live Insights, verification pages, content generator). A few copy tweaks and minor polish items would elevate it further.

**Overall Grade: 🟢 GREAT — Would confidently demo this today**

## Screen-by-Screen Review

### 1. Homepage (Portal Selection)

**What I see:** Clean landing page with two portals (Admin Dashboard, Brand Portal), quick links, and professional branding.

**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What works well:**
- Clear value prop: "Create verified, wearable-backed studies that transform customer outcomes into credible marketing claims"
- Two distinct paths are immediately clear
- Feature bullets under each portal explain what each does
- "Development Mode" badge correctly signals this is a dev environment

**What needs improvement:**
- The tagline is slightly technical — "wearable-backed studies" and "credible marketing claims" are our jargon. A brand founder would get it, but could be warmer.

**Suggested fix:**
> "Turn real customer results into marketing you can prove."

---

### 2. Admin Dashboard

**What I see:** Comprehensive dashboard with alerts, platform health metrics, stats cards, recent activity, quick actions, and brands overview.

**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What works well:**
- "Needs Attention" section at top — immediately shows what's urgent (shipping overdue, dropout risk, low waitlist)
- Platform Health metrics (91% compliance, 1.8 days avg ship time) — great for showing operational excellence
- Recent Activity feed adds life to the dashboard
- Quick Actions make common tasks one-click
- Brands Overview table is scannable and useful

**What needs improvement:**
- Nothing significant. This is demo-ready.

**Demo tip:** Lead with "Needs Attention" — it shows we're proactive about issues.

---

### 3. Studies List

**What I see:** Table view of all studies with status, brand, category, participants, rebate, and start date. Summary stats at top.

**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What works well:**
- Summary stats (20 Total, 10 Active, 6 Completed) give instant context
- Status badges (completed, active, coming_soon) are color-coded
- "Sample" badges distinguish demo data from real
- Search and filters (Status, Brand) are present
- Clean table layout

**What needs improvement:**
- "coming_soon" status badge could be more readable — suggest "Coming Soon" or "Draft"
- The status badge colors could have slightly more contrast (some yellows are hard to read)

**Suggested fixes:**
- Change "coming_soon" → "Upcoming" or "Planned"

---

### 4. Study Detail — Admin View

#### Overview Tab
**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What works well:**
- Clear header with study name, status badges (completed, Tier 2, Stress category)
- "View as Brand" button for easy perspective switching
- Four key metrics (Enrolled, Completed, Avg Improvement, Duration) are scannable
- Brand and Timeline sections give context
- "Sample Results Preview" with clickable participant cards is excellent

#### Fulfillment Tab
**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What works well:**
- "How Cohort-Based Recruitment Works" explainer is FANTASTIC — exactly what a founder needs to understand the model
- Visual flow diagram (Waitlist Builds → 24-Hour Window → Ship to Cohort → Repeat)
- Numbered steps with clear descriptions
- "Why cohorts?" explanation justifies the approach
- "Got it, hide this" respects experienced users

**Demo tip:** Always show this explainer first time — it's a key differentiator.

#### Compliance Tab
**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What works well:**
- Study Progress by Cohort visualization is beautiful
- Status breakdown (On Track, At Risk, Critical, Withdrawn) with counts
- Compliance Trend chart showing 89% with target line
- "Participants Needing Attention" table with specific names and statuses
- Simulation Controls (demo only) let me show the system in action
- Lifeline system explanation is clear

**What needs improvement:**
- Nothing — this is genuinely impressive for showing operational sophistication

#### Results Tab (Admin)
**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What works well:**
- Aggregate Results with +15% primary outcome
- Quick insight cards (Top Motivation, Exercise frequency, Supplement usage)
- Sample Participant Stories with beautiful cards showing real quotes
- "View Verified Story" links to public pages
- Participant Insights section with charts for Purchase Motivation, Exercise Frequency, Expected Results, Stress Level, Wearable Devices, Age & Gender

**What needs improvement:**
- The participant insights charts are dense — for a demo, might want to highlight one or two key insights rather than showing all six

#### Configuration Tab
**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What works well:**
- Study Configuration shows tier, wearable requirement, rebate, category
- Product Information with description and "How It Works"
- "What Participants Discover" bullet list is well-written

---

### 5. Study Detail — Brand View

This is the money view — what brand founders will see when they log in.

#### Overview Tab
**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What works well:**
- Cleaner layout than admin (less operational detail)
- Four tabs: Overview, Live Insights, Results, Your Widget
- Featured Result card with William M.'s story — before/after HRV data is powerful
- "Path to Research" showing 10 → 30 → 100 milestone — LOVE this! "Layaway plan on research" is perfect copy.
- "Powered by Reputable" + "Third-party verified" footer builds trust

**What needs improvement:**
- "Showing 5 simulated participants (1 completed)" is good for demo but should be hidden in prod

#### Live Insights Tab
**Rating: 🟢 GREAT — This is a WOW moment**

**What works well:**
- "What Your Customers Are Telling You" — immediately valuable
- Participant cards showing:
  - Demographics (age, location)
  - Why they're trying the product (with severity score!)
  - How long they've been struggling
  - What they've already tried
  - Baseline wearable data (HRV, Resting HR, Recovery Score, Stress Events)
  - Urgency score, Hopes to achieve, Stress Score
  - "In their own words" quotes
- Live Activity feed showing real-time signups and shares
- "Emerging Patterns" section showing:
  - Top challenges (before product) with percentages
  - What they've already tried
  - Average urgency level (7.3/10 Moderate)
  - Typical duration (6-12 months)
  - Pattern reliability (40%) — honest about confidence level
- "6 more for full positioning intelligence" progress bar

**Why this is a WOW moment:** This gives brand founders customer intelligence they can't get anywhere else. This is the differentiator. Demo this HEAVILY.

**Demo script:** "You're not just getting testimonials. You're getting market research. Look — 75% of your customers tried Yoga first and it didn't work. That's positioning gold."

#### Results Tab (Brand)
**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What works well:**
- 100% Improved, 4.8 avg rating, 1 completed, Verified status
- Participant result card with "Create Content" and "Verified Results" buttons
- HRV improvement visualization (38ms → 67ms, +76%)

#### Your Widget Tab
**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What works well:**
- Widget Style options (Trust Strip, Trust Card, Trust Section, Floating Badge) with clear descriptions
- Live Preview showing the actual widget
- Appearance settings
- Display Mode (Outcome Highlight)
- Featured Participants selector
- Embed Code with "Copy Embed Code" button
- Verification Page link with Copy/Open buttons
- "How It Works — FAQ" section answering common questions
- "3 Simple Steps to Install" — simple, clear, actionable

**What needs improvement:**
- "Best results on product pages" tip is great but could be more prominent

---

### 6. Verification Page (Public-Facing)

**Rating: 🟢 GREAT — This is another WOW moment**

**What I see:** Beautiful, comprehensive verification page showing Sarah M.'s full story.

**What works well:**
- "Independent Verification" header establishes credibility immediately
- Participant profile with "Verified Participant" badge
- Quote: "I was skeptical at first, but the data doesn't lie"
- 5-star rating with "Would recommend"
- Self-Reported Assessment showing 42 → 71 (+69% improvement)
- Wearable Data section showing:
  - Deep Sleep: +21%
  - Total Sleep: +9%
  - HRV: +17%
  - Resting HR: -6%
- "Both metrics improved" callout — showing data AND self-report align
- "About This Study" showing 47 real people, 38 improved, 9 didn't — TRANSPARENCY!
- "What Sarah Was Trying to Improve" journey visualization
- "Why This Is Different" (Data-Tracked, Independent, All Results Shown)
- Collapsible sections for deeper detail
- Reported Benefits tags
- QR code and Verification ID in footer

**Why this is a WOW moment:** This page alone sells the product. It's what every brand wishes they could show their customers. The transparency about "9 didn't improve" is counterintuitively trust-building.

**Demo script:** "This is what your customers see. Not a cherry-picked testimonial — a full, verified story with real data. And see here? We show everyone's results, not just the wins. That's what makes this credible."

### 7. Content Generator Drawer

**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What I see:** Slide-out drawer with ready-to-use content snippets.

**What works well:**
- "Best Bits" section with copyable elements:
  - Hero Metric: "+76% HRV (38ms → 67ms)"
  - Key Quote
  - The Struggle (their challenge before)
  - Verification Link
- "Captions" with two styles:
  - Casual: "Friendly, conversational"
  - Professional: "Credible, data-forward"
- Copy buttons for quick use
- "Show full caption" expandable

**What needs improvement:**
- Would love to see image/graphic generation or templates
- Could add platform-specific formatting (Twitter length, Instagram format)

**Demo tip:** This is great for showing brands how easy it is to turn results into social content.

---

### 8. Study Creation Flow

**Rating: 🟡 OKAY**

**What I see:** 4-step wizard (Basics → Preview → Customize → Publish).

**What works well:**
- Clean step indicator
- Fields are well-organized
- Rebate Amount shows "500 heartbeats" conversion and "Distributed over 28 days"
- Target Participants shows "Estimated cost: $2,500"
- Product Fulfillment options are clear
- "Allow participants without wearables" toggle with explanation

**What needs improvement:**
- Button is disabled until form is complete — but no validation messages show what's missing
- Could use inline validation or helpful hints
- "+ Add new brand" link goes to brand management instead of inline creation

**Suggested fixes:**
- Add field validation indicators (which fields are required)
- Consider inline "Create new brand" modal

---

### 9. Brands Management

**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What I see:** Card grid of brands with key metrics.

**What works well:**
- Summary stats (Total Brands, With Active Studies, Total Studies)
- Search bar
- Cards show brand name, contact, studies count, active badge
- "View Details" and external link buttons

**What needs improvement:**
- Nothing significant

---

### 10. Platform Settings

**Rating: 🟢 GREAT**

**What I see:** Comprehensive settings for assessments, profile questions, and rebate distribution.

**What works well:**
- Assessment Library showing 14 assessments across 4 tiers
- Profile Questions with Required/Optional indicators
- Rebate Distribution visualization:
  - Progressive 25% vs Completion Bonus 75%
  - Breakdown (Onboarding 5%, Daily Check-ins 14%, etc.)
- Example calculation showing $50 rebate breakdown
- "Heartbeat Value" explanation (1 heartbeat = 0.05¢)

**What needs improvement:**
- Dense for a first-time viewer — might need progressive disclosure

---

## Copy Quality Review

### Jargon to Fix

| Current | Suggested |
|---------|-----------|
| "wearable-backed studies" | "studies with real health data" |
| "4-tier measurement system" | "proven assessment methods" |
| "Trust Stack Verification" | "independent verification" |
| "co-primary endpoint" | "main outcomes measured" |
| "cohort-based recruitment" | (keep, but always with the explainer) |

### Copy That Shines

- "Layaway plan on research" — KEEP THIS. It's perfect.
- "Both metrics improved" — Clear and impactful
- "We show everyone's results — not just success stories" — Trust-building
- "6 more for full positioning intelligence" — Creates urgency and clarity
- "Pattern reliability: 40%" — Honest about confidence levels

---

## Top 5 Demo Moments

1. **Live Insights Tab** — "This is customer intelligence you can't get anywhere else"
2. **Verification Page** — "This is what credible looks like"
3. **Cohort Explainer** — "Here's how we batch shipments efficiently"
4. **Compliance Dashboard** — "Real-time visibility into participant engagement"
5. **Path to Research** — "Every participant builds toward publishable research"

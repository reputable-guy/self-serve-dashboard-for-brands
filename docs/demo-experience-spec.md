# The Demo That Sells Itself

*What makes a brand say "I NEED this" in 10 minutes?*

---

## The Core Insight

Brands already have star ratings. They have reviews. They have influencer testimonials.

**What they DON'T have:**
- Proof that their product actually works
- Before/after data from real customers
- Third-party verified results
- Stories they can use without looking like they wrote them

**The "aha moment":** When a brand executive sees a real customer's story — their struggle, their failed alternatives, their baseline data, and then their transformation with the product — backed by wearable data and third-party verification.

It's not "4.8 stars." It's *"Sarah hadn't slept through the night in 3 years. After 28 days with your product, her deep sleep increased 47%."*

That's what Trustpilot and Yotpo can't do.

## The Demo Flow (10 Minutes, 5 Beats)

### Beat 1: The Hook (1 min)
**"Here's your study running right now"**

Show the study overview — clean, confident, minimal.

What the brand sees:
- Study name + their logo
- 47 of 75 enrolled
- 23 active, 8 completed
- Status: Live

What they feel: *"This is real. This is happening."*

**What's there today:** Overview tab exists ✅
**What needs work:** Strip it down. Too many cards. The overview should be 3 numbers max and a status badge. Remove launch checklist, preview buttons, lifecycle bar for the demo view.

---

### Beat 2: The People (3 min) ⭐ THIS IS THE MONEY
**"Meet your customers — here's why they bought your product"**

This is the moment. Show participant story cards:

```

```

**Why this sells:** Brand executives almost NEVER see their customers this clearly. This is market research they'd pay $50K for, and it's happening automatically.

The voyeuristic element: *"You're watching real people discover your product."*

**Show 3-4 cards.** Different archetypes:
- The Desperate One (tried everything, last resort)
- The Skeptic (not sure this will work, but willing to try)
- The Optimizer (already healthy, looking for an edge)

Each one is a person the brand executive recognizes as their customer.

**What's there today:** Participant story cards exist ✅, archetypes exist ✅, early insights with progressive disclosure exists ✅
**What needs work:**
1. The card design needs polish — make it more emotionally compelling
2. The wearable baseline data should be more prominent (this is the differentiator)
3. Add a live "new enrollment" animation/feed that shows people joining in real-time
4. Consider: a "quote of the day" highlight at the top

### Beat 3: The Proof (3 min) ⭐ THIS IS THE CREDIBILITY
**"Here's what happened after 28 days"**

Show completed participant stories with before/after:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ✅ Sarah M. — Completed Day 28                │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The key insight:** The before/after with OBJECTIVE data (wearable) alongside SUBJECTIVE experience (testimonial) is the killer combination. Neither alone is enough.

- Reviews alone = "maybe they're paid"
- Wearable data alone = "so what, numbers"
- Together = "Holy shit, this actually works, and I can prove it"

**Show aggregate stats:**
- Average improvement: +23% sleep score
- 87% of participants reported improvement
- 4.6/5 average rating
- NPS: 72

**What's there today:** Results tab with stories ✅, verification pages ✅, before/after data ✅
**What needs work:**
1. The before/after moment needs to be more visual — maybe a simple animated bar chart that shows baseline → final
2. Aggregate stats should be prominent and simple — 3-4 hero numbers
3. Individual stories should link directly to verification page
4. The transition from "early insights" (Beat 2) to "completed results" (Beat 3) should feel like watching a journey unfold

### Beat 4: The Asset (2 min) ⭐ THIS IS THE ACTION
**"Here's how you use this on your product page"**

Show the widget on a mock product page:

```
Product Page: [Brand's Sleep Supplement]
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

    ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
    │  ✓ Verified by Reputable         │
    │                                  │
    │  28-Day Study • 47 Participants  │
    │  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━  │
    │  +23% Sleep Score                │
    │  87% Reported Improvement        │
    │                                  │
    │  "I'm finally sleeping through   │
    │   the night" — Sarah M.          │
    │                                  │
    │  View Full Study →               │
    └──────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What the brand sees:** Their product page, with verified evidence, ready to install.

Click "View Full Study" → lands on the verification page with full methodology, individual stories, data transparency.

**This is where the brand thinks:** *"My competitor has a 4.8 star rating. I have a verified study proving 23% improvement in sleep. Who wins?"*

**What's there today:** Widget preview ✅, product page demo ✅, verification page ✅, embeddable code ✅
**What needs work:**
1. The widget should auto-configure based on study results (no manual setup)
2. Show it IN CONTEXT — mock their actual product page
3. Make the embed code copy-paste simple (one line)
4. The verification page needs to feel premium and trustworthy

---

### Beat 5: The Close (1 min)
**"And here's what it takes to get started"**

Simple. Three steps:
1. We set up your study (we do this)
2. You email your customers this link (show enrollment link)
3. Results in 4-6 weeks

Cost: $X per study (50 participants)

**Don't show:** Configuration, settings, enrollment caps, email templates.
**Do show:** The enrollment page (clean, mobile-friendly, branded).

## What to CUT from the Demo

These exist in the dashboard but should be hidden or de-emphasized for the demo:

| Feature | Why Cut |
|---------|---------|
| Launch checklist | Internal, not brand-facing |
| Compliance tab | Too operational |
| Fulfillment tab | Too operational |
| Config tab | Too technical |
| Lifecycle bar | Confusing for new viewers |
| Cohort explainer | Too complex |
| Study creation form | They're not doing this yet |
| Email template config | You're handling this |

**The demo should have 3-4 tabs maximum:**
1. **Overview** (Beat 1) — Status + key numbers
2. **Participants** (Beat 2) — Stories + early insights
3. **Results** (Beat 3) — Before/after + aggregate stats
4. **Widget** (Beat 4) — Embed preview + verification link

---

## What to NAIL

### 1. Participant Stories (The Emotional Core)
- Card design must be beautiful and human
- Each card should feel like reading a mini-biography
- The wearable data should enhance the story, not overshadow it
- Progressive disclosure: story first, data second

### 2. Before/After Moment (The Proof)
- Visual. Not a table — a transformation.
- Side-by-side or animated transition
- Objective (wearable) + Subjective (testimonial) together
- Link to verification for credibility

### 3. The Widget (The Action)
- Must look like it belongs on a product page
- Auto-generated from study results
- One-click copy embed code
- Clicking through leads to full verification page

### 4. Speed to Value Message
- "First insights in 48 hours"
- "Full results in 4-6 weeks"
- Show the timeline visually

---

## Demo Data Quality

The simulation needs to feel REAL. Current issues:
- Generated names can feel fake
- Quotes need to feel like real human speech
- Scores and improvements need to be realistic, not too perfect
- Mix in some "meh" results (not everyone improves dramatically)

**Key:** Include at least one participant who saw minimal improvement. This paradoxically INCREASES credibility. A study where everyone improves 30%+ feels fake. A study where most improve and a few don't? That's science.

---

## The One-Sentence Pitch

When the demo is done, the brand should think:

> "I get verified proof my product works, from my own customers, with real data, ready to put on my website. And I don't have to do anything."

Everything in the demo should serve that sentence.

4. **Price sensitivity** is real - need clear ROI story
5. **Integration quality** matters enormously - Shopify ratings tell the story
6. **Customer success** drives retention - Yotpo's "extension of your team" model works

### The Pitch Against Each

**vs Trustpilot:**
> "Trustpilot tells customers you're trustworthy. Reputable proves your products actually work—with objective health data."

**vs Yotpo:**
> "Yotpo helps you collect reviews. Reputable helps you run clinical-style studies that generate defensible efficacy claims."
